This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To start this app run `Yarn install` or `npm install`.
To run tests run `Yarn run test` or `npm run test`.

Main libraries and concepts used in this repo are:
- [React](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- [react-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recompose)
- [ramda](http://ramdajs.com/0.23.0/)
- [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)

The reason for this repository is to demonstrate React and Redux proficiencies.
The decision to use Create React App (CRA) was one of convenience. Though I
don't believe CRA is ideal for production code, I do believe it saves a large
amount of time when prototyping.

Note: Running in windows 10 (not tested on a mac) takes a while to install. In a
future update to this code example, I will remove the create-react-app dependency
in favour for a hand rolled boiler plate of react.
